# Variables

- The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

    - Fixed values
    - Variable values

- Fixed values are called Literals.

- Variable values are called Variables.

## JavaScript ixed variable values

- The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. `Numbers` are written with or without decimals:

    ```javascript
    10.50
    
    1001
    ```

2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:

    ```javascript
    "John Doe"
    
    'John Doe'
    ```

## JavaScript variable declarations.

- In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

- JavaScript uses the keywords `var`, `let` and `const` to declare variables.

- An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

- `let` and `var` are used to declare mutable variables.
- `const` is used to declare variables that do not change (immutable).
